# Core Business Workflows Analysis

**Document Purpose**: Detailed analysis of VSCode's core business workflows  
**Analysis Scope**: Primary user workflows and business logic implementation  

## Overview

This document analyzes the core business workflows that define VSCode's functionality, providing detailed insights into how the application handles user interactions, data processing, and state management across all major features.

## 1. File Operations Workflow

### File Opening and Loading Process

#### Workflow Steps
```
User Action (Open File)
    ↓
File Service Resolution 
    ↓
Text File Editor Model Manager
    ↓
Content Resolution Strategy:
    - Provided Buffer (direct content)
    - Backup Recovery (crash/session restore)  
    - File System Read (disk access)
    ↓
ETag-based Caching Check
    ↓
Model Creation/Update
    ↓
Editor Rendering
```

#### Key Components
- **TextFileEditorModelManager**: Central coordinator for file operations
- **TextFileEditorModel**: Individual file state management
- **IFileService**: Platform-abstracted file system access
- **ETag Caching**: Prevents unnecessary disk reads
- **Backup Service**: Crash recovery and session restoration

#### Business Rules
1. **Cache-First Loading**: Always check ETag before disk read
2. **Backup Priority**: Restore from backup before file system if available
3. **Dirty State Preservation**: Maintain unsaved changes across sessions
4. **Encoding Detection**: Automatic encoding detection with user override
5. **Large File Handling**: Streaming reads for files exceeding memory limits

### File Saving Mechanism

#### Save Workflow
```
User Save Action
    ↓
Save Participants Execution
    ↓
Conflict Detection (File Modified Since Read)
    ↓
Content Serialization
    ↓
File System Write
    ↓
Version ID Update
    ↓
Dirty State Reset
    ↓
UI Notification
```

#### Auto-Save Business Logic
- **afterDelay**: Save after configured idle time
- **onFocusChange**: Save when editor loses focus
- **onWindowChange**: Save when application loses focus
- **off**: Manual save only

#### Error Handling
- **Save Conflicts**: File modified externally since last read
- **Permission Errors**: Read-only files or access restrictions
- **Disk Space**: Insufficient space for write operations
- **Encoding Errors**: Character encoding conversion failures

## 2. Search and Replace Workflows

### Full-Text Search Implementation

#### Search Architecture
```

    - Web Worker Search (browser environment)
    ↓
Results Collection and Ranking
    ↓

```

#### Search Business Rules
1. **Scoped Search**: Respect workspace folders and include/exclude patterns
2. **Ignore File Integration**: Honor .gitignore and custom ignore patterns
3. **Performance Throttling**: Limit concurrent search operations
