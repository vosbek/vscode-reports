4. **API Stability**: 200+ extension APIs require exact preservation
5. **Performance Requirements**: Sub-second response times must be maintained

### Critical Metrics for Planning
- **Development Effort**: Estimated 50-100 person-years for complete rewrite
- **Testing Requirements**: 500,000 LOC of tests to migrate/rewrite
- **Extension Compatibility**: 50,000+ marketplace extensions to validate
- **Platform Complexity**: 6 platform targets with specific optimizations
- **Performance Targets**: Maintain <3 second startup, <100ms interaction

### Risk Assessment by Metrics
- **High Risk**: Core editor (400K LOC), Extension system (200+ APIs)
- **Medium Risk**: Platform services (50+ services), Build system
- **Lower Risk**: Built-in extensions, UI themes, documentation

This quantitative analysis provides the foundation for understanding the true scope and complexity of migrating Visual Studio Code, highlighting both the challenges and the critical areas that require the most attention during a rewrite effort.
